### Mechanics
Dice in Deep Space D6 represent the different crewmen on board your ship and 6 dice are rolled each turn. These dice determine which crew members are available and thus, which actions you can take in a given turn. The possible crewmen, and therefore actions are:
  - Commanders -Allow you to change the value of other dice rolls
  - Tactical - Fire weapons at external threats
  - Medical - Heal injured crew members (return dice to play)
  - Science - Recharge the ships shields lowering incoming damage
  - Engineering - Repair ships hull (main health)
  - The final die face is not a crew member but represents additional threats to your ship that must be handled.
  
  Each turn additional threats are revelaed by flipping over cards in the play deck. You must use the actions you are alloted by die rolls to handle each of these threats. During your turn, after your actions you will follow the directions on each threat card and take damage accordingly. Play through the entire play deck without your ship being destroyed to win. 


### Controls
All controls will be handled with the mouse. There will be a button to roll die and advace through turn stages. Drag and drop will be used to assign die faces during play.
